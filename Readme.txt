Feature of the project:

1 This project is able to automate, execute and validate.

2  I have created a dynamic class to execute and using ApachePOI to read data from excelsheet. 

3 I have implemented this framework on the concepts of data driven and keyword driven.
  I have created 4 pacakages(request repository, common API methods, test classes and driver class)into the project in
  Request repository
  > PATCH Request Repository
  > POST Request Repository
  > PUT Request Repository
  Common API methods
  > API methods
  > Common utility method
  > PATCH API methods
  > PUT API methods
  Test classes
  > PATCH TC1
  > POST TC1
  > PUT TC1
  Driver package
  > Dynamic class
  > PATCH driver class
  > POST driver class
  > PUT driver class
  
4 The text execution is driven by dynamic driver class.

5 This project is capable of execution of all the test classes in one go at a same time.
